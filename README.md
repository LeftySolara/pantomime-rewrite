# Pantomime - An MPD client built on NCURSES

Pantomime is a simple NCURSES-based MPD client. It is still in the very, _very_ early stages of development.

## Building

To build and run Pantomime, simply run the build.sh script. It will create a `build` directory containing the main executable.

Eventually there will be an actual installer or package availble.

### Generating Documentation

To generate the documentation, just run "make doc". It will create a `build/doc` directory containing the HTML files generated by Doxygen. Simply open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.
